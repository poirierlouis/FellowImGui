# Development

## Live server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source 
files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You 
can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored 
in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma].

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your 
choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements 
end-to-end testing capabilities.
